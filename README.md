# NodeVoice — shared-state voice rooms

> **Three friends walk down a street, each with an iPhone voice agent.** *“Count to 100 together.”*
>
> They didn’t fail for lack of intelligence. They failed for lack of **shared state**. The fix isn’t better agents — it’s a shared room.

> Formerly **Room OS**. The original evidence links still exist for backward compatibility; the active proof embeds below use NodeVoice asset aliases.

NodeVoice is a local-first demo that shows *why* multiple AI voice agents fall into never-ending “yeah, exactly…” acknowledgement loops — and proves the fix: a **server-authoritative room state** that agents read from and write to, instead of reacting to each other’s transcripts.

The one line that matters:

> **Physically in the same room is not the same as computationally in the same room.**

<img src="docs/media/readme-hero.gif" alt="The quickstart, recorded: localhost:8787 opens on the live-room lobby, the bad-vs-good demo is opened, Run the comparison is clicked, and the split view runs — the transcript-only room loops stuck at 1 while the shared-state room counts upward with its authoritative roomState JSON live on screen" width="940">

*The quickstart path, recorded headless with Playwright ([`scripts/record-readme-hero.mjs`](scripts/record-readme-hero.mjs)): click **Run the comparison** and watch the transcript-only room loop at 1 while the shared-state room actually counts. Deterministic no-key demo — exactly what a fresh clone does.*

**▶ Try NodeVoice live (no laptop needed): [nodevoice.vercel.app](https://nodevoice.vercel.app)** — frontend on Vercel, state + voice on Convex.

## Quickstart (30 seconds)

```bash
npm install
npm run ui          # build the client + start the server
```

Open **http://localhost:8787/demo** and click **Run the comparison**. (`http://localhost:8787`
is the live-room lobby; the demo is one click away behind *“or watch the bad-vs-good demo →”*.)
No API keys needed for the core demo. Full details (hot reload, voice rooms, model router, Ollama):

## Read the V0 -> V3 live proof

The production comparison below was captured from four fresh live rooms, now available on
[nodevoice.vercel.app](https://nodevoice.vercel.app), rendered by
[HomenShum/FeatureClipStudio](https://github.com/HomenShum/FeatureClipStudio).
It starts the same task in V0/V1/V2/V3, sends the same mid-run human interrupt, and
opens the internal state layer for auditability.

The original Room OS asset names remain in the proof-studio repo for existing
receipts; this README points at the NodeVoice aliases.

The readable version is segmented by version instead of forcing everything into one
fast, compressed four-pane GIF. Each section includes a slow proof loop, a visual
state crop, and the full version-specific JSON captured from the live State drawer.

V0 can speak, but the steer is just another transcript row. There is no authoritative
count target, no count progress object, and no durable control event.

V1 gives the room a reducer. Floor, turn, next act, count, done, and loop-risk become
explicit state instead of being inferred from agent prose.

V2 keeps the reducer and routes human steering as typed room intent. A mid-run steer
becomes a state transition, not loose chat that the next model turn may ignore.

What time are we starting and ending?\n2. What vibe do we want: scenic, food, or low-key?\n3. Any must-try neighborhood or restaurant?\n4. Budget per person?\n5. Do we want to make one reservation?\n\n## Verification Plan\n- Check the chosen stops are open on Saturday.\n- Verify travel times between stops are reasonable.\n- Confirm whether reservations are needed.\n- Ensure the plan fits the agreed time window.\n- Sanity-check that the itinerary has no long backtracking.\n\n## Risks\n- Overplanning before time/budget preferences are known.\n- Too many stops causing rushed transit.\n- Popular venues needing reservations.\n- Weather affecting outdoor segments.\n- San Francisco neighborhood spread making the day feel fragmented.\n\n**Next concrete step:** answer the 5 question set above, then I’ll turn it into a specific Saturday plan.",

Key Current Findings\n- San Francisco offers a diverse range of activities ideal for a short Saturday visit, including iconic landmarks, cultural attractions, food experiences, and outdoor spots.\n- Popular tourist activities include visiting the Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman’s Wharf, Alcatraz Island, Chinatown, and riding historic cable cars.\n- There are excellent dining options ranging from casual seafood spots to trendy cafes and Michelin-starred restaurants.\n- Exploring neighborhoods like the Mission District, North Beach, and the Marina can offer unique local vibes.\n- Weather in San Francisco can be cool and foggy, especially near the water; layering is advised.\n\n### 2. Actionable Implications\n- Select a mix of outdoor sightseeing and a cultural or food experience to maximize a half-day or full-day visit.\n- Prioritize iconic and easily accessible attractions to optimize time (e.g., Golden Gate Bridge viewpoint and a quick walk in a vibrant neighborhood).\n- Consider booking any required tickets or reservations in advance (e.g., Alcatraz tours or popular brunch spots).\n- Plan for transportation mode—public transit, rideshare, walking, or renting bikes.\n\n### 3. Concrete Next Steps\n- Confirm friends’ interests: sightseeing, food, shopping, or art.\n- Decide the time window available on Saturday.\n- Choose 2–3 key attractions or neighborhoods to focus on.\n- Check availability and make reservations if needed.\n- Plan transportation logistics (e.g., cable car routes or rideshare pick-up points).\n\n### 4. Sources Used\n- San Francisco Travel Official Site (sftravel.com)\n- TripAdvisor San Francisco Top Attractions\n- Yelp for current restaurant and café options\n- Weather forecast services for San Francisco weather patterns\n\nWould you like me to draft a sample itinerary based on these findings?",

## The 2027 / 2028 read

The short version: **2027 is the moment AI labor becomes schedulable; 2028 is the moment control of that labor becomes the product.** The outside trend is no longer just "better chat." The converging pieces are long-horizon task reliability, tool protocols, background coding agents, synthetic data, reinforcement learning on real workflows, large-scale compute, power infrastructure, and governments treating model capability as strategic capacity.

The viral pattern has two halves. First, a new fragment of agency becomes visible: talks, thinks, uses tools, loops, remembers, controls software, works async, delegates. Then the failure wave goes viral too: looping agents burning money, demos that overclaim, agents saying work is done when it is not, unsafe writes, and production incidents. The counter-content spreads because it has drama plus receipts. That is the market signal: every agency reveal creates demand for a control layer.

```

The clearest outside anchor is [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/): its scenario moves from unreliable agents in 2025, to AI-assisted coding automation in 2026, to internal AI R&D acceleration and massive parallel agent labor in 2027. Its own caveat matters: 2027 was the authors' modal year at publication, not a certainty, and their later notes point to somewhat longer medians. The direction is still the part to take seriously.

Other research points the same way:

- [METR](https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/) frames progress as "task horizon": the length of tasks agents can complete has been growing roughly exponentially, with a reported doubling time around seven months on their 2025 measurement.
- [Stanford HAI's 2026 AI Index](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2026-ai-index-report) shows fast consumer adoption and a large investment surge; their 2026 takeaways also show agent benchmarks improving while real-world planning and robotics remain uneven.
- [Epoch AI](https://epoch.ai/publications/can-ai-scaling-continue-through-2030) argues that gigawatt-scale training facilities are plausible by 2030, while [IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/key-questions-on-energy-and-ai/executive-summary) projects data-center electricity use roughly doubling from 2025 to 2030 and AI-focused data-center use growing faster.
- Tool plumbing is becoming standardized: [Anthropic's MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), [OpenAI's agent-building stack](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/), and [GitHub Copilot's coding agent](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/) all push toward agents that can call tools, hold context, and work asynchronously.

What contributes to the **2027 moment**:

- Agent autonomy starts crossing from demos to useful chunks of work: software tasks, research tasks, browser/tool tasks, and issue-to-PR workflows.
- AI R&D becomes a feedback loop: agents help generate data, write experiments, evaluate outputs, and improve the next training run.
- Parallel copies matter: once agents are useful, organizations run fleets, not one assistant.
- The bottleneck moves from model intelligence to orchestration: floor control, task state, tool permissions, memory, audit, retries, and human steering.
- Security becomes first-order: model weights, tool credentials, prompt injection, insider risk, and cyber capability become board-level and government-level concerns.

What contributes to the **2028 moment**:

- Governance catches up to deployment: oversight committees, procurement rules, audits, incident reporting, and treaty-like monitoring become practical product requirements.
- Enterprise buyers demand control planes, not just APIs: approvals, traces, budget caps, durable state, rollback, and per-agent authority boundaries.
- Infrastructure constraints bite: power, chips, HBM, cooling, grid interconnects, and capital markets shape what can actually be run.
- Public legitimacy matters: labor displacement, safety leaks, and concentration of power push agent systems toward visible accountability.
- The winning product category is the runtime around agents: the room where humans, models, tools, and policies share state.

That is why this repo is not just a voice demo. The visible commit history has been converging on the same stack: shared room state, live traces, provenance badges, model routing, a hosted Convex ledger, reactive subscriptions, private rooms, durable count steers, and now steering-layer parity tests. The hard bugs we just fixed are exactly the 2028 class of bugs in miniature: stale commits, lost human steers, parser hijacks, divergent transports, and hidden caps. If agents become labor, the reducer is infrastructure.

## Two ways to run the live room

| | Transport | Backend | Good for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Local** (`npm run live`) | SSE + polling fallback, cloudflared tunnel | Node server on your laptop | fastest to hack, offline, on-site demo — laptop must stay awake |
| **Hosted** ([nodevoice.vercel.app](https://nodevoice.vercel.app)) | **fully reactive** — Convex WebSocket subscriptions (`useQuery`), zero polling | **Convex prod** (state + LLM/TTS actions + audio storage) + **Vercel** (frontend) | permanent URL, **laptop can sleep**, scales |

The same frontend serves both — transport is selected at build time ([`roomClient.ts`](src/client/live/roomClient.ts)):
`VITE_CONVEX_URL` set → the reactive Convex client (`useConvexRoom`); unset → the HTTP client
against the local Node server. See [Convex architecture](#convex--the-cloud-room-ledger) below.

## Live voice room (real devices) 🎙️

The demo simulates the room. `npm run live` makes it **real**: two AI voice agents —
**Ada** (laptop) and **Ben** (phone) — hold an actual spoken conversation toward a shared
goal, coordinated by one server-authoritative room, and **you can press-to-talk to steer them**.

```bash
npm run live         # build + start server + open a public HTTPS tunnel, prints a URL
```

- Open the printed URL on your **laptop** → *Create room* → a QR appears.
- **Scan the QR with your phone** → join as Ben → *Join & enable sound*.
- Press **Start** — the agents talk it out; hold **🎤 Hold to talk** to jump in by voice.
- Toggle **Traces** for the proof layer: every classify → reduce → guard → schedule decision
  as an auditable event stream (both transports), with expandable JSON payloads. The
  `openai · <model> · live` badge in the goal bar is the provenance claim: nothing is scripted.

**Pipeline (your keys, server-side only):** phone mic → **Whisper** (STT) → **chat LLM** →
**TTS** → audio. This sidesteps iOS Safari (which has no browser speech-to-text) and keeps
every key out of the browser. Voice defaults to **OpenAI TTS** (`nova`/`onyx`); set
`TTS_PROVIDER=elevenlabs` to use ElevenLabs instead. The deterministic room reducer still
owns the floor and suppresses acknowledgement loops — the whole thesis, but on real devices.

```
phone/laptop mic ─▶ /live (SSE + POST) ─▶ Whisper ─▶ LLM (room-aware) ─▶ TTS ─▶ audio
                          │
                          └── one shared roomState: goal · floor · turn · loopRisk
```

> The tunnel URL is **ephemeral** — it works only while `npm run live` and your laptop stay
> awake, and changes on restart. The **hosted** version ([nodevoice.vercel.app](https://nodevoice.vercel.app))
> has none of these limits — see below.

## Convex — the cloud room ledger

The hosted version makes **Convex the server-authoritative room-state ledger**, so the laptop is
out of the loop entirely. The mapping (the whole thesis in three primitives):

```
query    = reactive read / subscribe to room state + traces   (watchRoom, listTraces)
mutation = deterministic state transition — the reducer        (createRoom, submitHuman,
           lives here; the model is never trusted to coordinate  commitAgentTurn, setRunning)
action   = nondeterministic work: LLM / STT / TTS, commits      (runTurn, stepOnce,
           back through a mutation                                transcribeHuman)
```

```
 Laptop browser (Ada)                     iPhone browser (Ben)     ← both are just clients;
   create / join / step / run                join via QR             either can sleep
        │ useQuery(watchRoom) — WebSocket        │ (reactive subscription,
        │ useMutation / useAction                │  zero polling)
        └─────────────────────┬──────────────────┘
                              ▼
 ┌──────────────────────────  CONVEX  ──────────────────────────┐
 │ queries     watchRoom · listTraces        (reactive)         │
 │ mutations   reducer: floor / loop-guard / commit (bounded)   │
 │ actions     runTurn → OpenAI LLM + TTS → ctx.storage → commit│
 │ scheduler   ctx.scheduler hops (runToken cancels stale)      │
 │ storage     TTS mp3 (served by direct storage URLs)          │
 │ http.ts     /live/* bridge (+CORS) for non-React clients     │
 └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The hosted client subscribes with `useQuery(api.rooms.watchRoom)` — every server-side mutation
pushes the new snapshot to all devices over Convex's WebSocket. Measured on the deployed app:
**0 polling requests** across a full multi-turn run. The `http.ts` bridge stays for curl/scripts
and non-React clients.

Corrections baked in vs. a naive sketch: `commitAgentTurn` **advances state** (not just logs);
`traces`/`utterances` are **bounded** (agents amplify unbounded tables fast); auto-run is a
**durable scheduler hop chain** (pausable/restart-safe), not an in-action loop; TTS mp3 lives in
**Convex storage**; coordination stays in **mutations** so a slow/verbose model can't corrupt the
room.

### Deploying your own

```bash
# 1. Convex backend (dev for iteration, deploy for prod)
npx convex dev --once          # provision/push to your dev deployment
npx convex env set OPENAI_API_KEY <key>            # dev
npx convex deploy -y                                # push to PROD
npx convex env set OPENAI_API_KEY <key> --prod      # prod

# 2. Frontend → Vercel, pointed at the prod deployment
VITE_CONVEX_URL="https://<prod>.convex.cloud" \
VITE_LIVE_BASE="https://<prod>.convex.site" \
npx vite build --outDir ../../nodevoice-live --emptyOutDir
# add vercel.json (SPA rewrite) to the output dir, then:
cd nodevoice-live && vercel deploy --prod --yes
```

Requires a gitignored `.env.local` with `OPENAI_API_KEY` (and optionally `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`),
plus [`cloudflared`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/).

## Model router — measured, not guessed

The room's coordinator LLM is **swappable live** — a dropdown in the room header, or
`OPENAI_MODEL` at launch. The default (`gpt-5.4-mini`) and the ranking below come from an
empirical **proofloop** (`scripts/model-eval.mjs`): 6 models × 4 room scenarios
(planning-with-constraints, loop-trap, human-steer, convergence), each reply judged by
`gpt-5.4` on specificity / progress / non-looping / instruction-following / naturalness,
with latency + token cost measured per call.

![Model quality vs latency](docs/model-chart.svg)

| Model | Proofloop quality (1–5) | Latency (p50, full turn) | $ / turn | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **gpt-5.4-mini** · default | **4.75** | **2.8s** | $0.00072 | smartest mini that stays fast |
| gpt-4.1-nano | 4.15 | **2.0s** | **$0.000033** | cheapest + fastest |
| gpt-4.1-mini | 4.1 | 2.0s | $0.00014 | fast, balanced |
| gpt-4o-mini | 4.5 | 2.4s | $0.000051 | legacy baseline |
| gpt-5-nano | 4.6 | 3.4s | $0.00013 | cheap + smart, but slow |
| gpt-5-mini | 5.0 | 6.3s | $0.00079 | top quality — too slow for live voice |

Latency is `p50ms` from the eval receipt, [`docs/model-eval-results.json`](docs/model-eval-results.json)
(median wall-clock time for the full completion call, measured per turn during the eval run;
absolute numbers include eval-run contention, so treat them as relative, not best-case).

**Takeaways:** these are all capable models, so quality clusters tightly (4.1–5.0) — the
decisive axes are **latency** and **cost**. `gpt-5-mini`/`nano` reason before answering
(250–320 reasoning tokens; 3.4–6.3s p50); `gpt-5.4-mini` adaptively *skips* reasoning on
simple turns (~60 tokens, 2.8s p50) so it's the only "smartest-tier" model fast enough for
a live loop.
Reproduce anytime: `node scripts/model-eval.mjs` → writes `docs/model-eval-results.json`.

## Realtime vs. this STT → LLM → TTS pipeline

Your key can run the **Realtime API** (`gpt-realtime`, `gpt-realtime-mini`) — speech-to-speech
over WebRTC. It's lower-latency and supports natural barge-in, but it's the wrong fit *here*:

| Dimension | Chained pipeline (this app) | OpenAI Realtime |
|---|---|---|
| Latency / turn | ~1.5–3s (STT + LLM + TTS) | ~0.3–0.8s (streamed) ✅ |
| Barge-in / interruption | turn-based | native ✅ |
| **Cost / minute** | **~$0.03–0.04** ✅ | **~$0.30** (`gpt-realtime`) |
| Intermediate text / room-state control | full ✅ (that's the whole thesis) | hidden inside the audio session |
| Loop-prevention + visible `roomState` | trivial ✅ | hard |
| Implementation | plain HTTP, no WebRTC ✅ | WebRTC + ephemeral tokens |

**Cost math** — `gpt-realtime` bills audio at **$32/1M in + $64/1M out** (~$0.06 + $0.24 per
minute ≈ **$0.30/min**). The pipeline's dominant cost is TTS (`gpt-4o-mini-tts` ~$12/1M audio
tokens ≈ **~$0.006/spoken turn**); STT (`whisper-1` $0.006/min, or `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`
**$0.003/min**) only runs when *you* press-to-talk — the agents' words are generated text, never
transcribed. So the pipeline lands around **$0.03–0.04/min of conversation, ~8–10× cheaper**
than Realtime, while keeping the intermediate text the shared-room thesis depends on.

**Verdict:** stay on the chained pipeline for this turn-based, room-state-visible, cost-sensitive
demo. Realtime earns its price in a future *fluid, interruptible 1:1 voice* mode — not a
two-agent room you watch and steer.

## The UI

A dark **“observability console”** for watching the failure and the fix, side by side, live.

- **Live side-by-side streaming traces.** Press **Run** and both panels stream in turn-by-turn, in lockstep:
  - **Bad — No shared state** (red): three iPhones hear only each other’s audio → they loop on backchannels and never get past 1.
  - **Good — One shared room** (emerald): three iPhones + one authoritative room state + a scheduler → they count all the way up.
- **Live `roomState` inspector.** A syntax-highlighted, `● LIVE` JSON panel docked under the good trace, updating every turn (floor owner, next speaker, required act, counter, loop-risk) and flipping to `✓ COMPLETED` at the target.
- **Progress bar** with a glowing emerald fill and `current / target`.
- **Per-agent turn-taking.** `voice-a / voice-b / voice-c` are colour-coded (sky / violet / amber) so hand-offs are legible at a glance. The newest row fades in, is highlighted, and auto-scrolls into view.
- **Spoken narration.** The good run is read aloud with distinct Web Speech API voices per agent (with a watchdog so a flaky/backgrounded TTS engine can never hang the run).
- **NodeAgent mode.** A four-frame artifact chain (`context_bundle → grounded_answer → spreadsheet_delta → notebook_memo`) rendered as cards.
- **No API keys.** Model pickers, `N` (target), `Turns`, and an `Ollama` toggle live in the header. Ollama is optional.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run ui          # build the client + start the server
```

Open **http://localhost:8787/demo** and click **Run the comparison**. The bare
**http://localhost:8787** is the live-room lobby, which links to the demo.

For UI development with hot reload:

```bash
npm run start       # terminal 1 — API + static server on :8787
npm run dev         # terminal 2 — Vite dev server on :5173 (proxies the API)
```

---

## Why this fixes the loop

**Bad architecture** — agents react to each other’s words:

```
Agent A audio → Agent B transcript → Agent B says "yeah exactly…"
Agent B audio → Agent C transcript → Agent C says "yep exactly…"
→ infinite acknowledgement loop
```

**Room-state architecture** — agents react to authoritative state:

```
utterance → speech-act classifier → room reducer → scheduler → next required act → agent output
```

The room state is the single source of truth:

```json
{
  "task": { "kind": "count_to_n", "target": 100, "current": 42, "next": 43, "completed": false },
  "floorOwner": "voice-c",
  "nextSpeaker": "voice-c",
  "nextRequiredAct": "task_action",
  "suppressAcknowledgements": true,
  "loopRisk": false
}
```

Backchannels like “yeah exactly” are classified, stored, and then **prevented from scheduling another acknowledgement**. The scheduler hands the floor to the next speaker and requires a `task_action` to advance.

### Real-world architecture

```
iPhone A (voice agent) ──┐
iPhone B (voice agent) ──┼──►  Shared live room  (WebSocket / LiveKit / backend)
iPhone C (voice agent) ──┘            │
                                      ├── roomState (authoritative)
                                      ├── scheduler (floor control)
                                      └── speech-act classifier
```

Each iPhone runs its own voice agent locally, but all three **join the same live room**. The room state is authoritative and lives on a shared server. The demo simulates that room on the server.

- **Tailwind CSS v4** — theming via `@theme` design tokens in `src/client/index.css` (v4 does **not** auto-load `tailwind.config.js`, so the semantic tokens are wired in CSS)
- **shadcn-style primitives** — Button, Badge, Input, Select
- **react-o11y** (assistant-ui) — trace-tree rendering with `SpanPrimitive`
- **lucide-react** — icons · **Inter** + **JetBrains Mono** — typography
- **Web Speech API** — browser-native TTS, distinct voice per agent
- **tsx** — TypeScript server execution · **Vitest** — tests

## Roadmap — the Conductor Room

The demo simulates the room on one server. The product is a room that **real phones join**, so people don’t think about protocols.

**The honest boundary:** three iPhones running *closed, third-party* voice apps can’t silently share state — the OS sandboxes them and the only shared channel is sound. So the room can’t reach *inside* black-box agents; it coordinates *around* them (and *through* them once they integrate).

Three levels of solution quality:

| Level | Mode | Works with | Control | How agents get state |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Acoustic conductor** (sidecar) | any black-box voice app | low | one host device listens, transcribes, shows/speaks the next cue |
| 2 | **User-mediated room** (QR/App Clip) | any app + a human relay | medium | each user joins a room and reads a per-turn script into their app |
| 3 | **Native integration** (MCP / SDK / API) | participating agents | high | agents read/write shared state directly |

Planned build order:

```
V1  QR room + browser clients · local Gemma/Qwen coordinator via Ollama · text-mode · side-by-side bad vs good
V2  Mic input + STT (whisper.cpp) · local TTS (Kokoro) · roomState inspector · three-phone LAN demo
V3  OpenAI Realtime / Gemini Live adapters · per-phone low-latency voice · room still owns floor + goal state
V4  MCP server / SDK · third-party agents join the room natively · multilingual STT/TTS
```

Architecture the roadmap converges on:

```
User-facing:     QR code / link / App Clip / web room  (tap → join → talk)
Realtime layer:  WebSocket / WebRTC / native Multipeer
Agent-facing:    MCP tools  (create_room, join_room, observe_room, claim_floor, commit_task_step, …)
Core:            room reducer + scheduler + task ledger  ← the source of truth
```

The engineering rule that holds at every level:

> **The voice agent may speak, but the room decides why, when, and what it is allowed to say.**

## CLI demos

```bash
npm run demo:compare                      # side-by-side bad/good step generator
COUNT_TARGET=30 npm run demo:voice        # voice agent loop
npm run demo:node -- "Build a local-first agent room"   # NodeAgent artifact chain
```

## Optional local LLM mode

Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai), pull a model, and flip the toggle (or set env vars):

```bash
ollama pull gemma4:e2b            # edge voice / room-state default
ollama pull gemma4:12b            # stronger NodeAgent default

USE_OLLAMA=1 OLLAMA_MODEL=gemma4:e2b npm run demo:voice
USE_OLLAMA=1 OLLAMA_MODEL=gemma4:12b npm run demo:node
```

The deterministic state reducer keeps authority. The LLM phrases utterances/memos but cannot decide whether acknowledgement loops are valid.

## Optional OpenAI mode (compare demo)

With `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env.local` (server-side only — the key never reaches the browser), the compare demo can generate every utterance with a real model. Both sides go live: the bad side reacts to raw transcripts from private-state-driven prompts (no room state), the good side generates under the room's constraints. Whatever comes back is classified truthfully — the left panel is honest even if the model does not loop.

```bash
SOURCE=openai npm run demo:compare                       # CLI (default model: gpt-5.4-mini, override with OPENAI_MODEL)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/compare/demo -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"target":12,"turns":9,"source":"openai"}'
```

Every run discloses its provenance (scripted sim vs. live model + model id) in the UI panels and CLI output.

## Local HTTP API

```bash
npm run start

curl http://localhost:8787/api/models
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/compare/demo    -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"target":100,"turns":100,"source":"deterministic"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/voice/demo      -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"target":100,"turns":100}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/nodeagents/run  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"goal":"Build local room OS","model":"gemma4_12b"}'
```

```

The one structural rule: **anything two runtimes must agree on lives in
`src/core/` and is imported, never copied.** `tests/liveSteering.test.ts` asserts
that by object identity.

## Commands

The additive P1 NodeKit mapping is documented in
[`docs/nodekit-runtime-map.md`](docs/nodekit-runtime-map.md). It maps the existing
`src/nodeagents` runtime and voice-room reducer without moving either one.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run ui` | Build client + start server (http://localhost:8787) |
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server with HMR |
| `npm run build` | Build client for production |
| `npm run start` | Start server only (serves `dist/`) |
| `npm test` | Run Vitest tests |
| `npm run check` / `check:client` / `check:convex` | TypeScript type-check (server / client / Convex) |
| `npm run check:citations` | Verify every `.tours/` step and every `path:line anchor` citation in the docs still lands on the code it names |
| `npm run doctor` | All four checks above |
| `npm run demo:compare` / `demo:voice` / `demo:node` | CLI demos |
